- "I want a way to schedule events for people to play games."
- people can create any game they want
- anyone should be able to schedule an event for any game that has been added
-  I want people to say if they are coming. That way the person holding the event knows how many people to expect
- anyone can sign up for any event

### ASSUMPTIONS: 
- The `Game` table will have a one to many relationship with `GameType`
- since a game will be associated with 1 game type and
- a game type can be associated with many games.
- The `Game` will also have a one to many relationship with `Gamer` because gamers can create more than one game.
- The `Event` table will have a 1 to many relationship with `Gamer`, called the organizer, because gamers can host many events but an event will only have 1 host.
- Each `Event` should also include what game is going to be played at the event
- To keep track of who is attending events, there is a many to many relationship between gamers and events. There will need to be a join table to connect that many to many relationship.
- ask each Gamer to provide a short bio when they register
- There is a many-many relationship between the Gamers and Events to show who is attending an event
- The field on the Event model should be called attendees
